### Welcome to my page ! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Olha Lashchukevych, and I'm a sophomore Computer Science student at University of Illinois Chicago (UIC).  

My first experience with writing code was at the age of 11 ignited by a question that spontaneously popped up in my mind: how do websites come to be? That curiosity led me to immerse myself in the world of front-end development, learning and applying HTML and CSS for simple web pages. It was a huge success for a little girl, and it sparked a passion for technology that has only grown since then.

Now, as a sophomore CS student at UIC, Iâ€™ve expanded my skillset beyond web development to include C/C++, Python, and JavaScript. Looking forward, Iâ€™m excited to continue building projects that combine creativity with technical problem-solving. Iâ€™m always eager to learn new technologies and collaborate with others to create solutions that make an impact.

#### ðŸš€ Goals

I aspire to become a well-rounded software engineer who can contribute to meaningful projects that make a difference. I'm currently focusing on improving my understanding of data structures and algorithms, software design patterns, and learning more about web and mobile development, along with AI technologies.
